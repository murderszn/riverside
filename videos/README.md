# Hero Video Instructions

To add a video background to your hero section (similar to Canlis restaurant), place your video files here:

## Required Video Files:
- `hero-video.mp4` - MP4 format (recommended for web)
- `hero-video.webm` - WebM format (optional, better compression)

## Video Specifications:
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (videos loop automatically)
- **Content**: Show your cafe ambiance, food preparation, or welcoming atmosphere
- **File size**: Keep under 10MB for web performance

## Video Settings:
- Videos autoplay, are muted, and loop continuously
- Poster image shows while video loads
- Falls back to static image if video fails to load

## How to Add Your Video:
1. Record or obtain a suitable video for your cafe
2. Export in both MP4 and WebM formats
3. Name them `hero-video.mp4` and `hero-video.webm`
4. Place them in this `videos/` directory
5. The video will automatically appear on your website!

## Tips for Great Hero Videos:
- Show your cafe during busy times
- Include food, staff, and happy customers
- Use warm lighting and natural movement
- Keep text overlays minimal since your logo overlays the video
